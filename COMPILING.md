# General Overview
The build configuration management tool used for OpenBOR is cmake with a minimum version requirement of 3.22

Cmake can be installed via a standard package managing tool such (APT/YUM/Pacman) or can be downloaded via https://cmake.org (Source and Executables are Available).

# File Hierarchy
Within the root of the OpenBOR repository you will find CMakeLists.txt which contains the base configuration which covers all the pre-processor features supported by OpenBOR.  A subdirectory labled "cmake" contains target modules which are used to configure OpenBOR for your platform of choice.  Currently supported is the following list of targets:

    Linux   (linux.cmake)
    Windows (windows.cmake, windows-finalize.cmake)
    Darwin  (macos.cmake, macos-finalize.cmake)
    Wii     (wii.cmake)

# Building Target
Cmake provides various options for building a targets in general, however we are only going to focus on a subset of these options.  Typically running the cmake command without addition parameters is enough for the configuration system to identify which host you are running on in order to build a native target.  A few example are provided below to showcase how to configure and build a OpenBOR target.

## Configuring and Building a Native Target
Clear previous build directory, Set new configuration for distribution and build target:

    rm -rf build && cmake -S . --config Release -- -j `nprog`
    engine/releases/[TARGET]/OpenBOR

Clear previous build directory, Set new configuration for debuging the build target:

    rm -rf build && cmake -S . --config Debug -- -j `nprog`
    engine/releases/[TARGET]/OpenBOR

## Alternative Commands
Clear previous build directory, Set new configuration for distribution and build target:

    rm -rf build
    mkdir build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make -j `nproc`
    
    engine/releases/[TARGET]/OpenBOR

# Docker Integration
In this repository we also have support for Docker which allows us to build all supported targets via cross-compilation toolchains.

    .devcontainer/Dockerfile

## Prerequisite
Docker can be installed via a standard package managing tool such as APT/Yum or can be directly downloaded from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

First time users should install Docker Desktop as it provides a visual interface to manage images, containers and installs the command line tools for when the need arises for low-level management.

## Setting up Environment (VSCode)
Via VSCode Explorer, open the root of your repository and the IDE will automatically detect and ask permissions to install all necessary plugins.  You may have to open a few files if the automatic detection does not occur such as the Dockerfile, CMakeLists.txt and a source file.

Once the plugins have completed installing you maybe prompted to re-open the project within a container: Click Yes to restart VSCode within the container and simply use the Built-In Terminal to invoke your cmake build commands.

At this point you are ready to build all supported platforms from within the VSCode Terminal.  A script is provided to generate all build targets for distribution.

Terminal Tab:


        vscode âžœ /workspaces/openbor (compiling) $ ./build-all.sh

## Setting up Environment (Manually)
Using the Docker command line tool we will create a base image and then start a container which will be used for building cross-platform targets.

### Creating Base Image
Creating a base image only needs to be done once unless updates were performed to the Dockerfile which will require us to regenerate a new base image.  Assuming you are in the root directory of the repository type the following and wait for the process to complete.

    cd .devcontainer
    docker build -t openbor .

### Instanciating a Container
Return back to the the root of the repository and now you can invoke your development environment which will automatically mount the root directory of the repository and we can now build the targets.

        docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace openbor

        root@7e7774eba72b:/workspace$ ls -l

            total 44

### Building from within a Container
Using the build scripts provided in the repository we can now ensure that all supported targets can be built successfully and are ready for distribution.  Once completed simply type exit to end your container session.

        root@7e7774eba72b:/workspace$ ./build-all.sh
        
        root@7e7774eba72b:/workspace$ ls -l engine/releases/

        root@7e7774eba72b:/workspace$ exit

### Single line command for building all targets

    docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace openbor ./build-all.sh
