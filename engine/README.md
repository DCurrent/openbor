OpenBOR is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine, which was originally
created by the wonderful folks over at http://www.senileteam.com. 


## History
In 2004, Senile Team released Beats of Rage, a free beat-'em-up for DOS inspired
by SEGA's Streets of Rage series and using sprites from SNK Playmore's King of
Fighters series.  The game spread only by word of mouth, but it nonetheless
amassed popularity very quickly.  Senile Team soon released an edit pack allowing
anyone interested to create a mod for the BOR engine.

In 2005, Kirby2000 asked Senile Team to open the source code to BOR.  They
agreed, and OpenBOR was born.  Development on the engine was continued by the
community, and still is to this day.

## Available Platforms
OpenBOR has a very modular and portable design inherited from Beats of Rage. Ports
to the following platforms are currently supported:

* Android

* Linux
* Mac OS X
