 *  Using the SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG hint you can add support for controllers SDL is unaware of or cause an existing controller to have a different binding. The format is:
 *	guid,name,mappings
 *
 *  Where GUID is the string value from SDL_JoystickGetGUIDString(), name is the human readable string for the device and mappings are controller mappings to joystick ones.
 *  Under Windows there is a reserved GUID of "xinput" that covers any XInput devices.
 *	The mapping format for joystick is: 
 *		bX - a joystick button, index X
 *		hX.Y - hat X with value Y
 *		aX - axis X of the joystick
 *  Buttons can be used as a controller axis and vice versa.
 *
 *  This string shows an example of a valid mapping for a controller
