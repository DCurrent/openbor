OpenBOR for Android 1.4.0
----------------------
Originally ported by ported by UTunnels (utunnels@hotmail.com).
Modifications by CRxTRDude.

Release notes
----------------------
Note that these are version numbers that are used in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Any OpenBOR version can theoretically be used to compile this Android build.

1.4.0
- Rewritten video.c to add support to new functions by Plombo.
- Fixed video bugs Android-side brought about by rewrite. 

1.3.4
- Updated the SDLActivity.java to support external buttons. 

1.3.3
- Updated SDL to SDL2 2.0.1, the last of the SDL2 series to support Android 2.3.3 API out of the box. I also figured out the way to finally disable accelerometer without doing additional code, which I've done already in this release. Tested on the phone and it works perfectly.

1.3.2
- Updated the static library for libpng to 1.6.15. Removed the libz static library because libpng is now set up so it does not need it anymore, (it instead uses the zlib already present in the Android OS)

1.3.1
- Updated the static library for libogg to 1.3.2 and libvorbis to 1.3.4.

1.3
- SUCCESSFULLY added a wake lock which prevents OpenBOR to be destroyed by the OS itself during screen lock. (Note that the CPU still keeps running, so you will need to pause your game before you turn off the screen, otherwise the game keeps on going and kill your character.)
- Fixed the accelerometer by hardcoding it to be disabled in the first place.

1.1.2
- Added FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON to prevent the game from exiting, so you can watch the cutscenes without the worry about the app exiting on you (on the sacrifice of your battery power of course because the screen keeps on running).
- Modified androidmanifest.xml to reflect changes (versioning and cleanup)
- Various directory modifications and minor fixes.

1.1
- Modified the buttons to make them look better.

1.0
- Original port by UTunnels.

Developer's notes
----------------------
Precompiled static libraries include sdl 2.0.1, libogg 1.3.2, libpng 1.5.6 and libvorbis 1.6.15

Source code for those libs can be found on internet.

Regarding the feature where you can add a PAK file in the APK, file limit in a APK is 50 MB and is standard for the Android OS. Therefore, you will need to consider this when adding a full pak to the APK. 

Issues
----------------------
- Sound delay - Just a second though, latency is probably high, probably is hardware issue.

- Memory issues - For OGG in particular, it is very dominant, even uTunnels said so:
"Ogg seems to be a very cpu intensive format, besides openbor doesn't run another thread for audio. Try lower the compression level to see if helps a bit."

- WebM is not yet supported until a static library for libvpx has been compiled, which I'm still having a bit trouble.

- Issues in the main build as well.


Compiling requirements
----------------------

To compile this port, you will need to install the Android NDK and SDK properly, as well as installing Apache ANT.

This build is designed to be compiled on API 10 (Android 2.3.3), therefore this build requires Android 2.3.3 and up.

For Windows, you will also need Cygwin to run the various shell scripts in the source.

Compiling instructions
----------------------

0. Install and properly configure Android SDK and NDK as well as other dependencies (such as Apache ANT and Cygwin for Windows users). Then, on a newly downloaded source, you will need to run versions.sh either by compiling/building OpenBOR using tools or running the sh itself through Cygwin.

1. Copy the file 'copy_and_rename_me_to_local.properties' over and rename it to 'local.properties' and then appropriately edit sdk.dir variable to point to your Android SDK directory.  

2. You can now run build.bat to compile the code. This will create a debug APK that you can install on an Android device.

3. Your APK is compiled on 'bin\' as OpenBOR-debug.apk.

Optional: You can set your private key as well if you want to distribute it to Google Play, see http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html for details.
