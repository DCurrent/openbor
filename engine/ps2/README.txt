PS2Bor is a legal and open source port of the popular Beats of Rage engine
for the playstation2. PS2Bor does not contain any copyrighted material at
all and is not compiled or use any parts of sony code. In it's purest form
PS2Bor is a BOR pak file interpreter for the playstation2.

It was written from Neill Corlett's original port. Please see senile's
website at http://senileteam.segaforums.com/bor.php for more informations.

Since I do not own any right on the original code or whatever, and since the
original code DOESN'T contain any license, I won't try to enforce any kind
of license here. But, if you use/modify/enhance it, please be kind enough to
contact me, and submit patches.


This port uses PS2SDK, a freely distributed development library available
at http://www.ps2dev.org.

It also uses GsKit 0.1, by NeoV. Since I am waiting for GsKit 0.2, with new
features and tools, this actual version of PS2Bor does NOT contain pak file
selection, and it also has a few graphical glitches, which should hopefully
be fixed in a next version of PS2Bor, using GsKit 0.2.

There is a known sound glitch during loading time. I either suspect the
actual sound system (a custom modification of isjpcm) to be quite broken,
or the asynchronous fileio system from PS2SDK to be not working correctly.


Third party pak files will work with PS2Bor. A number of pak files were
tested during the development of PS2Bor but not all of them are guaranteed
to work. Please do not redistribute this binary along files that may
infringe on the copyrights of others.

Please note that the actual point of this release was only to have a port
of the original engine which was not using any bit of sony code (thus making
the _code_ legal). Furthermore, since it is illegal to possess the sony
SDK, compiling the original port was not possible for people unless doing
warez. This port is meant to be recompiled, modified and enhanced by people
using the free tools available.
