 # OpenBOR
OpenBOR is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine, which was originally
created by the wonderful folks over at [Senile Team](http://www.senileteam.com). 

## History
In 2004, [Senile Team](http://www.senileteam.com) released Beats of Rage, a free beat-'em-up for DOS inspired
by SEGA's Streets of Rage series and using sprites from SNK Playmore's King of
Fighters series.  The game spread only by word of mouth, but it nonetheless
amassed popularity very quickly.  Senile Team soon released an edit pack allowing
anyone interested to create a module for the BOR engine.

In 2005, Kirby2000 asked Senile Team to open the source code to BOR.  They
agreed, and OpenBOR was born.  Development on the engine was continued by the
community, and still is to this day.

## Platforms
OpenBOR has a very modular and portable design inherited from Beats of Rage - several ports have been made available.

### Current
These platforms are actively supported and may be compiled with the latest OpenBOR engine.

* Android
* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Wii
* PSP

### Discontinued

The following platforms are still available as legacy binaries, but are no longer supported and may not be compatible with current iterations of OpenBOR.

* Dreamcast
* GP2X
* GP2X Wiz
* OpenDingux (Dingoo A320 & GCW-Zero)
